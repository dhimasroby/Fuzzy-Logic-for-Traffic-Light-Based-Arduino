# [Arduino] Fuzzy-Logic-for-Traffic-Light-Based-Arduino

Fuzzy Logic Control as one of the application of artificial intelligence has been able to contribute to solve the
problem of traffic system on the highway. One of the implementation of fuzzy logic control system is to control
the indicator lights crossing on the highway. The fuzzy logic control traffic control system is effective to reduce
the risk of accidents caused by over-fasting lights, and reduce congestion. 
To realize fuzzy logic control on street lights controlling system then require tools that is photoelectric sensor at each end of zebracross andmicrocontroller Arduino uno r3 to implement fuzzy system into hardware that is traffic light. 
In this study using the simulation of 4 road crosses as a model with the most modeled vehicle number is 25 road penyebrang with
the longest time of 40 seconds. In the test results have been able to prove the change in the number of vehicles
and road penyebrang determine the time of indicator lights based on the densest point.
